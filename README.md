# AI_DEVICE_VOLUME_CONTROL
Smart AI-based system to control device volume using hand gestures

# AI Device Volume Control

This project is a smart AI-based volume control system that uses gesture recognition through computer vision techniques to control media volume on a device. Designed to enable touchless interaction, it combines the power of computer vision and audio device APIs to provide a hands-free, intuitive user experience.

## üìå Project Objective

To develop an AI-powered application that can detect hand gestures through a webcam and translate them into volume control commands such as volume up, volume down, mute, and unmute.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV  
- **Machine Learning**: MediaPipe (for hand tracking)  
- **Audio Control**: Pycaw  
- **Others**: NumPy, math

## Features
Real-time hand gesture recognition
System volume control via webcam
Touchless interaction
Visual feedback on screen
